Q1.What are conditional operators in java?
Answer.They are used when a condition comprises more than one boolean expression . We have 3 types of conditional operators - logical and , logical or and ternary operator.
  Logical -and operator(&&) : It is used when we want the condition to be true iff both the expressions are true .
Syntax : 
  if(condition - 1 && condition - 2) {
statement;
}
  Logical -or operator(||) : This operator is used when we are satisfied as long as any one of the boolean expressions is evaluated as true.
 Syntax : 
   if(condition - 1 || condition - 2) {
statement;
}
  Ternary operator(?:) : It is a smaller version for the if -else statement . If the condition is true then the statement - 1 is executed else the statement -2 is executed.
Syntax : condition ? statement - 1 : statement - 2;

Q2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands ?
Answer. There are two types of operators based on the number of operands : 
Unary operators : These operators require only one operand to perform operation on them. They are of two types : 
Increment operator (++): 
Pre increment operator
Post increment operator
                  b. Decrement operator(--) : 
                             1. Pre decrement operator
                              2. Post decrement operator
     2. Binary operator : These operators are used when there are two operands and any              mathematical operation is to be performed . They are of 5 types : 
+ :- plus
- :- minus
* :- multiply
/ :- division
% :- modulus division

Q3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
Answer. Let’s say we have a variable. Now, we want to do multiple operations on it based upon what value it is storing. In such cases we use switch statements .
It is like an if-else ladder with multiple conditions, where we check for equality of a variable with various values.

Q5. What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in java ?
Answer. A conditional statement is a set of rules considered valid if certain conditions are met . They start with a hypothesis and end with a conclusion and are sometimes referred to as if-then statements .
Conditional statements can be true or false. The structure of the statement , as opposed to its validity , makes it a conditional statement. 

When we have to check some conditions for one or more variables and then execute some output according to that condition. Then we use conditional statements.


Q6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
Answer.Syntax : 
     if (condition) {
         statement - 1
     } else {
          statement - 2
     }


Q7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
Answer. The 3 types of iterative statement in java are : 
The while loop
The for loop
The do -while loop

Q8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
Answer. For loop : For loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a whle loop, a for statement consumes the initialization , condition and increment / decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter , easy to debug structure of loop.

Do while loop : do while loop is similar to while loop with the only difference that it checks for the condition after executing the statement, and therefore is an example of exit control loop.

Q9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Answer. public class Demo {
                public static void main(String args[]){
                   for(int i = 1;i<=10 ;i++){
                         System.out.println(i);
                           }
                    }
               }
