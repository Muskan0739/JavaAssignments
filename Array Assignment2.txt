Q1. What is the default value of array for different data types?
Answer.For int datatype default value of array is 0.
Example : int a[] = new int[3];
    System.out.println(a[0]);//0
    System.out.println(a[1]);//0
    System.out.println(a[2]);//0


For float datatype default value of array is 0.0
Example : float a[] = new float[3];
    System.out.println(a[0]);//0.0
    System.out.println(a[1]);//0.0
    System.out.println(a[2]);//0.0



For byte datatype default value of array is 0
Example : byte a[] = new byte[3];
    System.out.println(a[0]);//0
    System.out.println(a[1]);//0
    System.out.println(a[2]);//0

For char datatype default value of array is u0000
Example : char a[] = new char[3];
    System.out.println(a[0]);
    System.out.println(a[1]);
    System.out.println(a[2]);



Q2. Can you pass the negative number in array size ?
Answer. No, you cannot pass negative number in array size. If we declare an array with negative size it would result in a negative array size exception.
 Example : int[] a = new int[-5];// NegativeArraySizeException

Q3. Where does array stored in JVM memory?
Answer.Since arrays are refrence types (we can create them using the new keyword ) these are stired in heap area.

Q4. What are the disadvantages of array?
Answer.Some disadvantages of array are : 
Once we create the array, the size of array cannot be increased/decreased.
It sores only homogeneous data elements
Insertion and deletion becomes tedious
There are chances of wastage of memory space if elements are lesser than the allocated size.
We must know before hand how many elements will be there in array.

Q5. What is an anonymous array in java ? Give an example?
Answer.An array without a name is called Anonymous Array.This type of array is created just for instance use.
Example public class Demo{
public static void main(String... args){
add(new int ̈]{10,20,30,40});
add(new int ̈]{10,20});
add(new int ̈]{});
}
public static void add(int ̈] a){
sum+=0;
for(int i=0;i<=a.length;i++){
sum+=a ̈i];
}
System.out.println("The sum is ::"+sum);
}
}


Q6. What are the different ways to traverse an array in java?
Answer.You can traverse through an array using for loop or forEach loop.
Using for loop - instead on printing element by element , you can iteratr the index using for loop starting 0 to length of the arraay .
Using the for each loop - Since JDK1.5 Java intriduced a new for loop known as foreach loop or enhanced loop , which enables you to traverse the complete array sequentially without using an index variable. You can traverse through the array with less effort using this.

Q7. What is the difference between length and length(0 method. Give an example?
Answer.Length :- It is a property of array type class. This gives you the size of array.
Example : class Hello{
public static void main(String args[]){

int arr[] = {1,2,3,4 };
System.out.println(arr.length);

}
}
Output : 4

Length() :-It is a method of String class. This gives you the length of given string.
Example : class Demo{
public static void main(String arg[]){

string name = “Muskan”;
System.out.println(name.length());
}
{
Output : 6
